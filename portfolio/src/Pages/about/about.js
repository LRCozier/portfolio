        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Amidst the upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I stumbled upon a newfound passion that has since become the cornerstone of my journey:
            coding. As the world slowed down, I delved into the intricacies of programming, captivated by its limitless possibilities and the power to 
            create something tangible from mere lines of code. Since that pivotal moment, I have devoted myself wholeheartedly to mastering this craft, 
            constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Coding has not just become a hobby or a career pathâ€”it has become an integral part 
            of who I am, driving me forward with an insatiable curiosity and a relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
